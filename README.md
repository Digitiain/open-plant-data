# Open Plant Data

Open data relating to plants (mostly veg, flowers and other garden plants). 

# Why?

A few other open data sources exist, but none with the level of fidelity that many gardeners would require, to be able to optimise their use of space. 

The plan is to produce a highly detailed dataset that can be contributed to by others, which meets that need. 

I was inspired to do this by watching Gardeners' World üòÅ and then trying to grow in a very small space as much as possible, in different lighting conditions, soil quality, etc. 

## Notes

- Planting info (distance, soil type, depth, etc.)
- Latin and common names, split into components (e.g. genus)
- Pollenators (Boolean, plus broken down by pollenator, each Boolean)
